# libmonome

**v1.4.2**

---------------------

libmonome is a library for easy interaction with monome serial devices. It
currently runs on Linux (on which it is primarily developed), OpenBSD, 
Windows, Windows Linux System, and Darwin/macOS.

The core library provides C and Python/Cython bindings to manage serial devices directly.  

In addition, an OSC wrapper called `monomeserial` allows remote device interaction 
from high-level software environments like Max/MSP.

## build requirements

at minimum:
- a C compiler, either `gcc` or `clang`
- `python` (version 2.7 or higher)

additionally by default (but can be disabled at configuration time):
- `liblo` for OSC support
- `udev` on linux/WSL for device management (falls back on direct interaction with the sysfs)

## building

the basic procedure is typical of WAF projects:

`./waf configure` to set up the build
`./waf` or `waf build targets=...` to perform a build
`sudo ./waf install` to install artefacts (primarily `libmonome.so` and its aliases.)

additionally, the following configuration options are accepted (also viewable with `./waf --help`):

```
    --disable-osc       disable OSC/liblo support [enabled by default]
    --disable-udev      disable udev support [enabled by default]
    --enable-python     enable python bindings [disabled by default]
    --python=PYTHON     python to build against
    --pythondir=PYTHONDIR
                        python to build against
    --pythonarchdir=PYTHONARCHDIR
                        python to build against
    --enable-multilib   on Darwin, build libmonome as a combination 32 and 64 bit library [disabled by
                        default]
    --enable-debug      Build debuggable binaries
    --enable-embedded-protos
                        Embed protos in the library
    --enable-mac-bundle
                        look for protocol libraries in a Mac bundle's Frameworks directory
```
